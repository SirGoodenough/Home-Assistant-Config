  name: Media Player Script Blueprint 2023-12-09
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: >
    This provides a way to play canned media files with the big 
      long list of YAML entries but keep the main script or automation clean. 
      All that is required there would be a simple line like:  
        '- service: script.media_player_doorbell_sound'

        You can manually edit this to include multiple media players, or just
        use the pick list to pick one.

        A sample path may be 'media-source://media_source/local/sample_file.mp3'.

        This is where you match how the content is encoded with 
        how the player will play it. Trial and error here can be your friend 
        unless you are much better at figuring this stuff out than me. 
        I generally only use 'audio/mp3' and occasionally 'image/jpg'.
