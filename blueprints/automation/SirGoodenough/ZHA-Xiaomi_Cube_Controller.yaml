  name: Aqara Magic Cube ZHA - 2024-06-04
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: "This Blueprint uses a Z2M Event Sensor to sort out the 38(+54) unique
    actions available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. (Some unique actions are
    available thru templating only. See the related document.)\nThe split out of functions
    gives you the ability to assign local scripts or functions to do the things you
    want the remote to do.\nFunctions that are left empty will simply do nothing.\n\n###
    \U0001F34E There is a set of 36 event functions that will trigger on specific
    actions on specific sides that are listed as **Group 1 actions \U0001F34E**.\n\n###
    \U0001F352 There is a set of 6 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
    on *ANY* side that are listed as **Group 2 sctions \U0001F352**.\n\n### \U0001F350
    There is a set of 30 event functions that will trigger on cube flips to & froma
    specific sides that are listed as **Group 3 sctions \U0001F350**.\n\n### \U0001F355
    There are 2 actions (shake and drop) that only occur once and are OK to be combined
    with any other group. Listed as **Group 4 sections \U0001F355**.\n\nPlease be
    aware that ALL actions except the 2 listed above,\n\U0001F355 will trigger an
    action in **ALL 3 groups at the same time** every time. Therefore I suggest if
    you just have a couple of things you want this remote to do that you choose the
    *ANY / Group 2 / \U0001F352* events.\nIf you want more than a few events, you
    should select actions in **Group 1 / \U0001F34E OR Group 3 / \U0001F350**.\nWith
    careful selection you can use mixed groups, but you run the risk of a single cube
    action triggering more than 1 Home Assistant action and making a mess of things
    \U0001F371.\n\n#### NOTICE: This cube *can* be triggered 124 ways, but only 38(+54)
    of them are unique (with templating).\n\nThere is sample code to make the template
    sensor in the help file on GitHib named [Zigbee2MQTT - Xiaomi Cube Controller.md](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/Zigbee2MQTT%20-%20Xiaomi%20Cube%20Controller.md)
    & in the [community page related to this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee2mqtt-xiaomi-cube-controller/393203).\n\nWithin
    this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last action that
    the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple Template
    sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent. Thie will help when setting
    up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours. _________________________\n>

    was virtually the same as my Z2M version,  and leverage all the documentation
    and code samples there but still port it  to ZHA. I also had a better idea for
    troubleshooting info. _________________________\n\n[Community link for this blueprint](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-xiaomi-cube-controller/495975)\n\n##
