  description: >
    This script was invented to be used with my Device Tracker-Monitor-Notifier
    Blueprint. I released it as a standalone Script Blueprint because I saw
    an opportunity to add another tool to my toolbox, and possibly to others
    toolboxes

    There are other places in my HA config where I need to reset something 
    and now I can use this thing.

    It asks for the entity or list of entities that you want to reset and how
    long you want them to be off for the reset.

    When a Script using this Blueprint is called, it will use Homeassistant
    turn off to shut them off, wait the delay, then turn them back on.
    Simple Simple, but if you are doing it over and over in an automation,
    this cleans up the code quite a bit.

  input:
    target_entity:
      name: The thing to toggle
      description: The Switch or Boolean or whatever that you want to toggle
        with a delay.
      selector:
        entity:
          multiple: true
    time_off:
      name: How long the thing should be off 
      description: >
        How long the thing should be off to make certain it gets a
        proper reset. I'm defaulting at 59 seconds,
        but anything is reasonable depending on the device.
        After the delay the thing will be turned back on.
      default:
        days: 0
        hours: 0
        minutes: 0
        seconds: 59
      selector:
        duration:
          enable_day: true

sequence:
  - alias: Turn off the device
    service: homeassistant.turn_off
    data: {}
    target:
      entity_id: !input target_entity
  - delay: !input time_off

    service: homeassistant.turn_on
    data: {}
