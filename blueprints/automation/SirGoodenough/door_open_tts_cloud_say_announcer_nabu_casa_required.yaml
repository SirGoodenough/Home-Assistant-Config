  name: Door open tts.cloud_say announcer (Nabu-Casa required) - 2023-09-22
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: >
    This uses tts.cloud_say from Nabu-Casa to tell you a door is open too
    long and a door has been closed.

    ðŸ“© There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. ðŸ”— [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)

        Entity that initiates the announcement. Actually any entity that changes
        its state from off to on will work here, You would just need to enter the
        entity manually if it's not a binary sensor.
        However this BP is expecting 'on' or 'off' as the available states.
      selector:
        entity:
          multiple: true
          filter:
            - domain: binary_sensor

      name: 'Did I remind you?'
      default:

        This is optional.
        Original behavior of this BluePrint was that every time you close the door,
        the action to thank you for closing the door is activated. This is fine
        for some things, but in a door that you go in and out of a lot, it gets
        annoying when your Google thanks you everytime the door closes.

        So to get around that currently your choice is to leave the door close 
        announcement empty and therefore silent, which I don't like.
        This is a new way to handle that problem.
        
        You can leave this at the default (empty) and the behavior of the BP will
        be exactly what it was in the past. This ensures your old set-up will not
        break if you upgrade the BluePrint.

        Or if you create an 'input_boolean'/'toggle' helper and put the name in
        here, the behavior will be the door is silent as long as you do not
        exceed the time it takes to get to the warning message that the door is
        open. If that warning message triggers once, it will then thank you after
        you close it.

        So normal door operation it's just a door. If you leave it open too long,
        it reminds you it is still open, and when you eventually close it,
        it will thank you for closing it.

        Create a helper and select it here for that style of action.

        If you are OK with the default voice then just leave this field empty.

        If you want to change the voice, you need to pick from [This List, TTS_VOICES section](https://github.com/NabuCasa/hass-nabucasa/blob/master/hass_nabucasa/voice.py)
        being certain to match the country code you picked above with one of
        the voices available for that country code on that list.

        Failure to do so will result in no voice being heard.


        Also picking a voice here results in your pick for Gender to be ignored.

        If you want to know what these sound like, well, you are just going to
        have to try them and see what you like.

        If you are en-US, you might want to paste this in there for some fun:
