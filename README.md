# Welcome to my Home Assistant Configuration

For those that have asked, here is how I split out my scripts file and still use the UI to do editing and making blueprints:

ðŸ”€ [Split Configuration HA Official Instructions](https://home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/splitting_configuration/)

ðŸ”€ [Doc and Frenck with a live Demo](https://youtu.be/FfjSA2o_0KA)

AND if you want to split your scripts up so that the script UI editor works and your files are split, [look here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/script-editor-and-split-up-files/40459/20) 

Or go into a terminal in HA and do this:

```ln -f /config/scripts.yaml /config/#path_to_your_subfolder ```

and in configuration.yaml do this:

```script: !include_dir_merge_named /config/#path_to_your_subfolder```

Then put your split folders here for scripts.

This creates a symbolic link from the main script.yaml located in the subfolder.  The UI editor can destroy and create the one in the main filder on UI edits, and the one looked for in creating the system workings is in the dub folder as wel via a sym link.

Let me know if you have a suggestion.
