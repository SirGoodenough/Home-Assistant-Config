  name: Media Player Script Blueprint 2022-12-12
  description: "This provides a way to play canned media files with the big 
      long list of YAML entries but keep the main script or automation clean. 
      All that is required there would be a simple line like:  
        '- service: script.media_player_doorbell_sound'

    ðŸ“© There is not an official version control system for Blueprints.  However I have 
    found something that comes pretty close.  It is not perfect, but for **MOST** 
    Blueprints, it does just fine.  I encourage you to check this script out and use 
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. ðŸ”—
