  name: Aqara Magic Cube Zigbee2MQTT - 2022-02-15.1
  description: 'This Blueprint uses a Zigbee2MQTT built sensor to sort out the multitude
    of commands from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote.  The split out of functions gives
    you the ability to assign local scripts or functions to do the things you want
    the remote to do. Functions that are left empty will simply do nothing.

    There is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file on GitHib named
    the same as this one and in the community page related to this.

    Within this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last command
    that the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss.  From there a simple
    Template sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent.  Thie will help  when
    setting up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours.

    This was forked from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/z2m-xiaomi-cube-controller/263006
    V1.2 project authored by luckypoppy and the friends he pulled together to create
    the base. I sincerely thank Him (Them) for their work.  I felt there needed to
    be more documentation for rookie users to properly set this up.  I had quite a
    few questions and when I saw a few questions in that chat from people struggling,
    I wanted to help I also had a better idea for troubleshooting info that didn''t
    involve the log writes.'
