  description: >
    This script was invented to be used with my Magic Cube Blueprints. I released
    it as a standalone Script Blueprint because I saw others struggling with how
    so convert cube rotation to light dimming in other places.


    To use this blueprint, install it from the source in the normal way.
    After that add your unique name for the Script, and add an icon and change
    the entity_id if desired.
    You should only need to run the blueprint once, as you will be calling the
    unique name/entity you added above to use the code.
    This script has no inputs in the Blueprint screen because all the data is
    added to control the action live at each use.


    This requires you call this script wth 2 data values. One is a positive or
    negative number between 360 and -360 that in the original, represents the
    input angle from the cube movement. The other data point is the entity of
    the light or light group that you are trying to control.
    
    ***NOTE:*** the trigger variable below will be different for Z2M and ZHA
    and others. Look at my documentation for that cube integration help if
    you need it.

    Sample call / use of this script:
      ```yaml
      - service: script.cube_dimmer_control
        data:
          angle: '{{ trigger.event.data.args.relative_degrees | float(0.0)}}'
          light: light.bulb1
      ```

  input:
    sensi:
      name: Sensitivity of the cube rotational motion.

        This sets how ''fast'' the changes happen compared to how far you move
        the cube.
        Higher percentage is faster, lower is slower.

        I have found that 40% is a good number, but you can adjust as desired.

        This sets the lowest brightness it will set before it turns off.
        Some bulbs react poorly below a certain percent, you can adjust that here.

        I have found that 10% is a good number, but you can adjust as desired.
