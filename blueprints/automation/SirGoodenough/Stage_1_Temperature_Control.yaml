  author: SirGoodenough
  description: >
    This ramps up the thermostat just enough at a time to keep your stage 2 
    (or emergency) heat from activating. This is meant to be run for instance in 
    the morning when the system is recovering from overnight thermostat set-back,
    and you don't want it to kick in the stage 2 expensive heat source.

    There is an optional facility to disable this based on zone occupancy.
    Also there is a roll-your-own condition statement for things I haven't thought of.

    ğŸ“© There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. ğŸ”— [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)

        If it changes the goal set temp, it waits this long before it rechecks.
