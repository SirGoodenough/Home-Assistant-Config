  name: Aqara-Magic-Cube-T1-Pro-(CTP-R01) - 2022-03-01-A
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: 'This Blueprint uses a Zigbee2MQTT built sensor to sort out the 58+
    unique commands (118+ total) available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. (Some unique commands
    listed as + are not counted & available thru templating only. See the related document.)

    **NOTE:** This blueprint is for the PRO cube version ONLY and is not fully compatible
    with the original version of the cube. Links for those are in my [GIT repository](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints).

    This cube has an ''Action'' mode (Shown below with this graphic: 🫳 ACTION MODE ONLY 🫳 )

    and a ''Scene'' mode (Shown below with this graphic: 👀 SCENE MODE ONLY 👀 ).

    Make sure the cube is in the mode you think it is in when triggering it.
    The functions are separate. IE ''Action - slide'' will do something different from ''Scene - slide''.

    The split out of functions gives you the ability to assign local scripts or functions
    to do the things you want the remote to do.

    Functions that are left empty will simply do nothing.

    #### 🍎 There is a set of 36 + 18 actions that will trigger on specific actions on specific sides that are listed as **Group 1 🍎**

    #### 🍊 There is a set of 6 + 3 actions that will trigger on specific actions on *ANY* side that are listed as **Group 2 🍊**

    #### 🍐 There is a set of 30 + 30 event functions that will trigger on cube flips to & from specific sides that are listed as **Group 3 🍐**

    #### 🍩 There are 5 actions (shake & throw for each mode & hold in scene mode) that only occur once in each mode & are OK to be combined with any other group in that mode. 🍩

    Please be aware that ALL actions except the 4 listed above,
    🍩 will trigger an action in **ALL 3 groups in the matching mode at the same time** every time.
    Therefore I suggest if you just have a couple of things you want this remote to do that
    you choose the *ANY / Group 2 / 🍊* events. 
    Action events and Scene events are separate from each other.

    If you want more than a few events, you should select actions in **Group 1 / 🍎
    OR Group 3 / 🍐**.

    With careful selection you can use mixed groups, but you run the risk of a single
    cube action triggering more than 1 Home Assistant action and making a mess of
    things 🍱.


    #### NOTICE: This cube *can* be triggered 124 ways, but only 38(+54) of them are
    unique (with templating).

    ##### This blueprint has been known to freak out when there are spaces or odd characters
    in the MQTT Topic. Make sure there are no spaces, ONLY a single word,
    and ONLY A thru Z, a thru z, and 0 thru 9 in the topic.
    (```  /  ``` is ok between device and topic) If there are,
    you will need to change the name of the cube to remove those characters.

    ### IF YOU SEE --> TemplateError: Must provide a device or entity ID

    If you get an error like that, The friendly_name in Z2M likely does not match the 
    friendly_name on HA. To fix go into the Z2M ```Open web UI``` and set the 
    friendly_name there. Setting this in just HA or in Z2M without ticking the update HA
    box will cause this. See the blueprint documentation page for details.


    There is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file on GitHib named
    [Zigbee2MQTT - Xiaomi Cube Controller MQTT Triggered.md](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/Zigbee2MQTT%20-%20Xiaomi%20Cube%20Controller%20MQTT%20Triggered.md)
    & in the [community page related to this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee2mqtt-xiaomi-cube-controller/393203).


    Within this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last command
    that the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple
    Template sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent. Thie will help
    when setting up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours.

    1.2 project authored by luckypoppy and the friends he pulled together to create
    the base. I sincerely thank Him (Them) for their work. I felt there needed to
    be more documentation for rookie users to properly set this up. I had quite a
    few questions and when I saw a few questions in that chat from people struggling,
    I wanted to help. I also had a better idea for troubleshooting info.

    📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. 🔗 [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)
