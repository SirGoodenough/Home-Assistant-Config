  name: Aqara Magic Cube Zigbee2MQTT MQTT Triggered - 2024-06-02
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: "This Blueprint uses a Zigbee2MQTT built sensor to sort out the 38(+54)
    unique commands available from the Xiaomi Magic Cube Remote. (Some unique commands
    are available thru templating only. See the related document.)\nThe split out
    of functions gives you the ability to assign local scripts or functions to do
    the things you want the remote to do.\nFunctions that are left empty will simply
    do nothing.\n\n### \U0001F34E There is a set of 36 event functions that will trigger
    on specific actions on specific sides that are listed as **Group 1 actions \U0001F34E**.\n\n###
    \U0001F352 There is a set of 6 event functions that will trigger on specific actions
    on *ANY* side that are listed as **Group 2 actions \U0001F352**.\n\n### \U0001F350
    There is a set of 30 event functions that will trigger on cube flips to & from
    specific sides that are listed as **Group 3 actions \U0001F350**.\n\n### \U0001F355
    There are 2 actions (shake and drop) that only occur once and are OK to be combined
    with any other group.  Listed as **Group 4 sections \U0001F355**.\n\nPlease be
    aware that ALL actions **except** the **Group 4 actions \U0001F355** will trigger
    an action in **ALL 3 groups at the same time** every time. Therefore I suggest
    if you just have a couple of things you want this remote to do that you choose
    the *ANY / Group 2 / \U0001F352* events.\nIf you want more than a few events,
    you should select actions in **Group 1 / \U0001F34E OR Group 3 / \U0001F350**.\n**Group
    4 actions \U0001F355** will not affect others.\nWith careful selection you can
    use mixed groups, but you run the risk of a single cube action triggering more
    than 1 Home Assistant action and making a mess of things \U0001F371.\n\n#### NOTICE:
    This cube *can* be triggered 124 ways, but only 38(+54) of them are unique (with
    templating).\n\nThere is sample code to make the template sensor in the help file
    on GitHib named [Zigbee2MQTT - Xiaomi Cube Controller MQTT Triggered.md](https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/Zigbee2MQTT%20-%20Xiaomi%20Cube%20Controller%20MQTT%20Triggered.md)
    & in the [community page related to this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zigbee2mqtt-xiaomi-cube-controller/393203).\n\nWithin
    this blueprint there is an event handler that will latch the last command that
    the blueprint finds and sends that to the event buss. From there a simple Template
    sensor can grab it and show you the last action sent. Thie will help when setting
    up new functions and to troubleshoot strange behaviours.\n\n> This was forked
    from https://community.home-assistant.io/t/z2m-xiaomi-cube-controller/263006 1.2
    project authored by luckypoppy and the friends he pulled together to create the
    base. I sincerely thank Him (Them) for their work. I felt there needed to be more
    documentation for rookie users to properly set this up. I had quite a few questions
    and when I saw a few questions in that chat from people struggling, I wanted to
    help. I also had a better idea for troubleshooting info.\n\n[Community link for
