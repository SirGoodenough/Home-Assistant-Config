  name: Tasmota EZ-Button for Update and Restart All 2023-03-01
  author: SirGoodenough
  description: "## 🧿 This will create 3 buttons to help you. 🧿  

    #### 1:

    Press a button to restart ALL Tasmota Devices (Also to use during 
    Home Assistant Restart to get all current State and Sensor readings)  

    #### 2:
    
    Press a button to update a couple of Tasmota devices to test that the 
    new version will not break something,  
    (Think of these units as your canary's in the coal mine.)  

    #### 3:

    Press a button to update ALL Tasmota devices to the latest version. 

    ## 🧿 There are 5 Requirements to allow this to work. 🧿  

    #### A: ✔️

    You need the Home Assistant Tasmota Integration to be functional on your system
    and HA needs to be able to see and interact with the devices. 
    This Blueprint does not do that for you. 

    #### B: ✔️

    This script makes the assumption that the default GroupTopic of 'Tasmotas' 
    is available on all your Tasmota Devices. 
    If you have devices that have been upgraded from pre V7 or so, 
    they may be missing this GroupTiopic. 
    If this is the case you will have to add the GroupTopic 'Tasmotas' to your device. 
    'https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/#control'

    #### C: ✔️

    Your Home Assistant Instance needs to be or be communicating with an MQTT Broker. 
    But this is easy because in order to have A: running, MQTT is a requirement for A:. 

    #### D: ✔️

    Tasmota Devices firmware default MQTT topic is set to: ```%prefix%/%topic%/```  
    If you did not change the topic in your Tasmota Devices then leave it as the
    default here as well. The other option available to you is to flip them
    as I do in my Home Assistant personally.

    #### E: ✔️

    Your Tasmota devices need to be updated to the same 'breaking change' generation 
    as the Released version of Tasmota for this to be able to update. 
    Again this is easy because in order to have A: running, 
    Tasmota V9.2 minimum is a requirement for A:. 
    Tasmota has had breaking changes in it's history. Therefore you should never 
    stray from the upgrade path listed in the Tasmota Docs when upgrading. 
    To upgrade your Tasmota firmware, you need to follow the path, 
    or risk bad things happening:


    v1.0.11 🔀 v3.9.22 🔀 v4.2.0 🔀 v5.14.0 🔀 v6.7.1 🔀 v7.2.0 🔀 v8.5.1 🔀 v9.1 🔀 Current release.


    That means you currently need to manually update your firmware to v9.1 minimum 
    for these buttons to work going forward.

    📩 There is not an official version control system for Blueprints. However I have
    found something that comes pretty close. It is not perfect, but for **MOST**
    Blueprints, it does just fine. I encourage you to check this script out and use
    it to easily check if I have updated this blueprint. 🔗 [koter84 Blueprint Update Script](https://github.com/koter84/HomeAssistant_Blueprints_Update/)
